:::tip Web Worker
A web worker is a type of JavaScript program that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. This makes it possible to run long-running scripts, such as ones that handle complex calculations or access remote resources, without blocking the user interface or other scripts. Web workers provide an easy way to run tasks in the background and improve the overall performance of web applications.
