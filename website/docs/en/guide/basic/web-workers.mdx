# Use Web Workers

This chapter introduces how to configure and use [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) in Rsbuild project.

import WebWorkers from '@en/shared/webWorkers.mdx';

<WebWorkers />

## Use Web Workers

[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) is first-class citizen of Rspack, which means you don't need any loader to use web workers directly in Rspack or Rsbuild projects.

For example, create a file called `worker.js`:

```js title=worker.js
self.onmessage = (event) => {
  const result = event.data * 2;
  self.postMessage(result);
};
```

Then use this worker in the main thread:

```js
const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));

worker.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('The results from Workers:', event.data);
};

worker.postMessage(10);
```

:::tip
When you use Web Workers, you may encounter CORS exceptions. In this case, you can use [import-web-worker](https://github.com/jantimon/remote-web-worker) or refer to [Discussions - webpack 5 web worker support for CORS?](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/discussions/14648) to get the solution.

## Build Web Workers outputs

Rsbuild supports building Web Workers outputs independently, which is helpful when you need to provide Web Workers outputs for use by other applications.

You can set Rsbuild's [output.target](/config/output/target) configuration to `'web-worker'`, and Rsbuild will generate build outputs suitable for the Web Workers environment.

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    target: 'web-worker',
  },
};
```
